# webex-client-tracker

WIP....

Currently grabs the latest Webex Meetings Client app version and performs a download of the files via Webex CDN

TODO:

- Track current release vs version last downloaded to know when an update is needed.

Configure:

- Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your Webex site name (without .webex.com)
- npm install
- node app.js
